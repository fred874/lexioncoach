  <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated: February 23, 2026</strong></p>
  <p>This Privacy Policy describes how Lexion IELTS Coach ("we", "us", or "our") handles information in connection with the LEXION mobile application ("App").</p>

  <h2>1. Information We Do Not Collect</h2>
  <p>LEXION does not collect, transmit, or store any personally identifiable information. All study data — including essays, speaking recordings, vocabulary progress, and band scores — is stored locally on your device and never sent to our servers.</p>

  <h2>2. Information Processed Temporarily</h2>
  <p>When you use the AI writing evaluation feature (Pro users only), your essay text is sent to our secure server proxy solely to obtain feedback from an AI language model. This text is not stored, logged, or used for any other purpose. The connection is encrypted via HTTPS.</p>

  <h2>3. In-App Purchases</h2>
  <p>Subscription purchases are processed entirely by Apple through the App Store. We do not receive or store your payment information. Apple's privacy policy governs all payment data.</p>

  <h2>4. Notifications</h2>
  <p>If you grant notification permissions, LEXION sends local study reminders. These are generated on your device and do not involve any data transmission.</p>

  <h2>5. Analytics</h2>
  <p>We do not use any third-party analytics, advertising SDKs, or tracking tools. We do not track you across apps or websites.</p>

  <h2>6. Children's Privacy</h2>
  <p>LEXION is not directed at children under 13. We do not knowingly collect any information from children.</p>

  <h2>7. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>We may update this policy from time to time. We will notify users at least 30 days before any material changes take effect by posting a notice in the App.</p>
