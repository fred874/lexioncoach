  <h1>Terms of Use</h1>
  <p><strong>Last updated: February 23, 2026</strong></p>
  <p>These Terms of Use govern your use of the LEXION mobile application ("App") operated by Lexion IELTS Coach ("we", "us", or "our"). By downloading or using the App, you agree to these terms.</p>

  <h2>1. Use of the App</h2>
  <p>LEXION is an IELTS preparation tool for personal, non-commercial use. You may not reverse engineer, copy, or redistribute any part of the App.</p>

  <h2>2. Subscriptions</h2>
  <p>LEXION offers optional Pro subscriptions (weekly, monthly, 3-month, and annual) that unlock premium features. Subscriptions are billed through your Apple ID. Your subscription automatically renews unless cancelled at least 24 hours before the end of the current period. You can manage or cancel your subscription in your Apple ID settings at any time.</p>

  <h2>3. No Guarantee of Results</h2>
  <p>LEXION is a study aid and does not guarantee any specific IELTS band score. AI-generated feedback is for guidance only and does not constitute official IELTS assessment.</p>

  <h2>4. Limitation of Liability</h2>
  <p>To the maximum extent permitted by law, our liability for any claims arising from your use of the App is limited to the amount you paid for your subscription in the most recent billing period.</p>

  <h2>5. Dispute Resolution</h2>
  <p>Any disputes will first be addressed through informal negotiation via email at <a href="mailto:lexioncoach@gmail.com">lexioncoach@gmail.com</a>. If unresolved within 30 days, disputes will be settled through binding arbitration under the laws of Ghana.</p>

  <h2>6. Changes to These Terms</h2>
  <p>We may update these Terms from time to time. We will notify users at least 30 days before any material changes take effect by posting a notice in the App.</p>
